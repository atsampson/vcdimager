This is GNU VCDImager, the GNU (Super)VideoCD authoring solution.

This package contains 'vcdimager', an image authoring tool, and
'vcdrip', a VideoCD ripping tool. 'vcdrip' can be used to rip mpeg
streams from VideoCD images and to show VideoCD information about the
image.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for general compilation and installation
instructions.

See the file BUGS for known issues.

The user manual is kept as texinfo documentation.

See http://www.gnu.org/software/vcdimager/ for latest official news
about GNU VCDImager.

(until GNU VCDImager becomes ready for production, that is, officially 
released, see http://www.hvrlab.org/~hvr/vcdimager/ for bleeding edge news)
