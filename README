This is GNU VCDImager, the GNU (Super)VideoCD authoring solution for
mastering, extracting and analyzing Video CDs and Super Video CDs.

This package contains 'vcdimager', an image authoring tool, and
'vcdrip', a VideoCD ripping tool. 'vcdrip' can be used to rip mpeg
streams from VideoCD images and to show VideoCD information about the
image. Furthermore, 3 XML based tools have been added recently:
 
1) vcdxgen - a xml description generator, with an interface similiar
   to the classic vcdimager frontend.

2) vcdxbuild - the image builder, which takes a xml description (and
   the files referenced within) for the to be built image.

3) vcdxrip - the vcd extraction tool. this tool completes the cycle by
   giving the possibility to extract the (s)vcd structure of an cd image,
   and give back a xml description + mpeg items of it.

For simple PBC-less VCDs the classic 'vcdimager' tool will be enough,
but if advanced VCD features are needed, like menues, playlists,
additional entry points, auto pause points and so on, the XML based
tools are required to make use of. Examples and more information about
the XML structure will be added on http://www.hvrlab.org/~hvr/vcdimager/

released, see http://www.hvrlab.org/~hvr/vcdimager/ for bleeding edge
news, especially for the unstable series)
