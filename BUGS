compilers/architectures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This package has been developed with GNU CC in mind. Caution has been
taken to stay compatible with other compilers, but there's been no
testing or whatsoever to ensure anything. 

Most of the code is ISO C compliant, with the exception of the
following features not contained in ISO C99:

 *) zero sized arrays used in otherwise empty structs
 *) uint8_t used as bit-field type 
 *) use of braced-groups within expressions

This package has been tested at least on ppc, alpha and ia32
architectures -- it should work on 64bit big endian as well.  If in
doubt, you can try to run the regression checks with 'make check',
which should at least check for _obvious_ missbehaviour...

try avoiding gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.0) -- it is known
to slightly miscompile vcdimager.

the following gcc versions seem to create good code:

gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-81)
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)



vcdimager/vcdxbuild
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 *) scantable creation/playing time detection still not accurate enough
 *) mpeg analyzation doesn't detect all non-conforming parameters
 *) memleaks exist
