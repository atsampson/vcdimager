compilers/architectures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This package has been developed with GNU CC in mind. Caution has been
taken to stay compatible with other compilers, but there's been no
testing or whatsoever to ensure anything. This package has been tested
on ppc, alpha and ia32 architectures -- it should work on 64bit big
endian as well.

try avoiding gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.0)  -- it is known
to slightly miscompile vcdimager.

the following gcc versions seem to create good code:

gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-81)
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)

vcdimager/vcdxbuild
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*) scantable creation/playing time detection still not accurate enough
*) mpeg analyzation doesn't detect all non-conforming parameters
