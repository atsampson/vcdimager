- Let people know of a pending release; 
  no major changes before release, please

- test on lots of platforms; sourceforge compile farm, for example

- "make distcheck" should work.

- Go over Changelog and add NEWS. Update date of release.

- Remove "cvs" from configure.ac's release name. E.g.
    define(RELEASE_NUM, 75)
    define(LIBVCD_VERSION_STR, 0.$1cvs)
                                   ^^^
    SPEC_VERSION=0.7.23cvs
                       ^^^
- Make sure sources are current and checked in:
    cvs update -dPA .
    cvs commit .

- autogen.sh && make && make check

- make doxygen documentation
  cd docs/doxygen; ./run_doxygen

- Tag release in CVS: 
   cvs log -h configure.ac
   cvs tag release_... .

- "make distcheck" one more time

- Get onto ftp.gnu.org. I use my perl program, e.g.
   gnu-ftp-upload libcdio 0.75

- Update/Announce on Freshmeat
  http://freshmeat.net/projects/vcdimager/ "add release" generally
  
  The NEWS file is your friend.
