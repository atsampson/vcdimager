@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

Note in the guide, we use the term VCD to mean some sort of Video
Compact Disk. There are various formats of Video Compact Disks, the
oldest format of which is called VCD followed by a version number:
1.0, 1.1 or 2.0. Hopefully by context it should be clear whether we
are referring to a class of Video Compact Disks or the specific older
format called VCD @emph{version-number}.

@value{program}'s mission in life is to display the contents of a VCD
image. Well, that's not actually true---if given an audio CD (CD-DA)
or some other kind of CD, @value{program} will try to display some
information about that, perhaps just a list of the tracks, with
varying degrees of success; However VCDs are what @value{program}
understands best and it will you the most detail about.  The disk
``image'' does not have to reside on a physical Compact Disk;
@value{program} understand the BIN/CUE disk-image format used by a
popular DOS/Window mastering tool.

You might use the information from @value{program} as a diagnostic or
analytical tool. It may help you understand a particular VCD that you
have. Or it might be useful in conjunction with or in debugging a VCD
you are creating (``authoring''). But debugging is probably best left
for another tool; @value{program} will only let you display information, you
can't modify anything with this tool and it is not interactive.

Although I imagine most of the time this is how you will use
@value{program}, there are some subsidiary uses.

@value{program} shows information about a VCD and as such the
information shown reflects, sort of, the way the information is
stored. So in a sense @value{program} can teach you a little bit about
how a VCD is laid out.

In writing an VCD input plugin for a media player, I wanted to get
bits of information about the VCD to display in the media player, such
as the VCD format used and the volume name. Before writing a C library
for such purposes, a lower-tech, and more loosely-coupled way to do
this was used. The program ran @value{program} with the specific
information request and parsed the text output. For example, to get just
the format that the VCD on the``default'' CD-ROM device is in you
might run:

@smallexample
  vcddump --no-banner --show-format
@end smallexample 

To get the album information you might run:

@smallexample
  vcddump --no-banner --show-info album
@end smallexample 

After doing this for a while and seeing this was useful, I then wrote
a VCD ``info'' library. A library is much faster and furthermore much
of the information is saved away in memory reducing the amount of disk
I/O. Later it turned out that I could shift the I/O completely from my
program and use the I/O from that or another library, but that's a
different story. What's relevant is that after creating this library,
I then modified @value{program} to use this library. The
@value{program} code then got shorter (as some of it getting moved
inside the vcdinfo library), and this program served as a test bed for
the library. (It also happens that the input plugin was much harder
and slower to debug than @value{program} since it is a ``shared
object'' and part of a larger program with many other such shared
objects.)

So the last thing that @value{program} may be of useful for is if you
want to see how to use the vcdinfo library; you can consult the source
program and see how @value{program} gets its information via vcdinfo.

@node Command Options
@chapter Command Options

There are a number of miscellaneous options, but there are two broad
categories of options. There is a set of options for specifying what
to dump, these all start @kbd{--show-} and another set of options
which specify where the CD-ROM or CD-ROM disk-image is.

@menu
* Where Options::     Options controlling where to read from 
* What Options::      Options controlling what do you want shown
* Other Options::     Other miscellaneous options
@end menu

@node Where Options
@section Options controlling where to read from 

@subsection BIN or CUE file

Options controlling where the CD-ROM or CD disk image are
@kbd{--bin-file} (@kbd{-b}), @kbd{--cue-file} (@kbd{-c}),
@kbd{--cdrom-device} and the ``intelligent'' option
@kbd{--input}. These options are mutually exclusive, use only one
option from this set.

The option @kbd{--bin-file} and @kbd{--cue-file} indicate to read
from a file containing an image what might be burned onto Compact
Disk. The format is expected to be in the BIN/CUE format that cdrdao
uses and is used by a popular DOS/Windows CD mastering tool. If you
use the --bin-file option, the file read is expected to be the
``.BIN'' part---this is the bulk of the data.  If you use
@kbd{--cue-file} the file read is a funny sort of TOC (Table of
Contents) file. The corresponding BIN file (which again contains the
bulk of the data) is not taken from the FILE statement inside the CUE
file, but it is constructed from the CUE file name by replacing ".cue"
by ".bin".  The CUE file must have exactly one FILE statement.

If you do not specify a file name after @kbd{--bin-file}, a default
name is used ``VIDEOCD.BIN'' is probably used; likewise if you do not
specify a filename after --cue-file a default name is used, probably
``VIDEOCD.CUE.'' These names I believe are the default output file
names used when you use vcdimager or vcdxbuild.

It is preferable to specify a CUE file over a BIN file since this will
give @value{program} TOC and, in particular, track information that it
cannot get otherwise.

@subsection CD-ROM Device

The option @kbd{--cdrom-device} is used when you want to read from a
Compact Disk. The name given would be the device name. If you don't
specify a device, a default will be selected based on the Operating
System or information that can be gleaned from the OS. For example on
Linux, the default device may be @kbd{/dev/cdrom}, while on Solaris it
might be @kbd{/vol/dev/aliases/cdrom0}.

@subsection Intelligent Input

The kind of where option tries to be intelligent by trying to figure
out whether the thing you are referring to is a device or a bin/cue
disk image of a CD.

Currently the algorithm it uses is pretty simple. If the thing
referred to is what in Unix is called a ``block'' or ``character''
device, then it assumes a device name. When you do ``long listing''
(``ls -l'') of the name and track down possible symbolic links
you will see a ``b'' or ``c'' in the first colum if the file is a
block or character devcies.

If the thing referred to in an @kbd{--input} option is a ``regular''
file then it is assumed you have a file image of a CD. If the filename
ends (i.e. the extension is) ``.bin'' or ``.BIN'' then we assume a
``BIN file'' and if the filename ends ``.cue'' or ``.CUE'' then we
assume a CUE file. 

Althought this algorithm is subject to change and there may be more
sophisticated or alternative methods, in practice I think this does
pretty much what's expected. 

@node What Options
@section Options controlling what do you want shown

@value{program} is pretty flexible about the information it can show
you.

By default @value{program} will show just about everything it can
about a VCD image. There is additional information you can get using
the option @kbd{--verbose}, but this is of a debugging nature. 

However if you specify something in particular to dump, for example to
dump track information via command option @kbd{--show-tracks},
@value{program} switches behavior and shows you almost nothing except
what you asked for. You don't have to ask for just one item at a time,
you can list many individual items.

Most of the individual items that can be shown are part of a larger
group listed in @ref{Output Sections,,Output Sections}. For example to
show the volume id of the VCD image which resides in the PVD
sections of output you would use the option @kbd{--show-pvd vol}.

@cindex suboptions
To show everything in one of these large sections you give the section
name followed by ``-all.'' So to see the entire PVD section you would
use the command option @kbd{--show-pvd-all}.

@node Other Options
@section Other Miscellaneous options

@table @code
@item --help
@cindex @code{--help}
This option give a list of options type @kbd{--help}. @kbd{-?} is an
abbreviation however you will probably have to ``escape'' the question
mark so that the shell doesn't interpret this; i.e. you may have to
type @kbd{-\?}.

@item --usage
@cindex @code{--usage}
This option shows an abbreviated usage message

@item --sector-2336
@cindex @code{--2336}
This option only makes sense if you are reading from a file CD-image.
This indicated to @value{program} to assume a 2336-byte sector mode
for image file.

@item --verbose
@itemx -v
This opton gives more verbose, debugging  output.

@item --terse
@itemx -t
This option is the same as giving the combined options
@kbd{--no-header --no-banner --no-delimiter}.  This option can be
useful if this program is getting called for information from another
program and you don't want to have filter this information out.

@item --no-banner
@itemx -B
Do not show program banner header and CVS Id line. This would be
useful in a regression test program where you want to check the output
but know that the version information is going to change over time.

@item --no-delimiter
@itemx -D
Do not show delimiter lines around various the sections of @ref{Output
Sections,,Output Sections}.

  -q, --quiet                 show only critical messages

@item --version
@itemx -V
Display version and copyright information (the stuff that is
suppressed by @kbd{--no-banner} and exit after displaying this
information. Sometimes, you just wanna know what version you got.
@end table

@node Output Sections
@chapter Output Sections

When you run @value{program} to display the contents of an entire disk,
unless you use the option @kbd{--no-delimiter} (@kbd{-D}) you'll notice large
sections of output separated by a string of dashes like this:

@smallexample

These separate the major logical sections of a VCD

@end smallexample

A little about the funny ``attribute'' characters at the beginning of
left-hand side of the listing. For the most part it looks like what
you would get in a Unix listing. Except there are these 1's and 2's
before what in unix would be the user/group/other mode attribibutes.
Those numbers indicate whether the track is ``mode2 form1'' or ``mode2
form2.'' So the example above, AVSEQ01.DAT is in a mode2 form2 track
while every other entry listed is in a mode2 form1 track.  The movie
part is is this mode2 form2 track while the remaining meta-data part
is in a mode2 form1 track.

Another unusal thing about that single mode2 form2 track containing
AVSEQ01.DAT, is that there seem to be two numbers listed before the
AVSEQ01.DAT entry. All the other mode2 form1 entries have a single
number listed beforehand. The first number (63954208) is the number of
bytes that is occupied on the disk proper. The second number in
parenthesis (563593216) is the number of bytes if you assumed the file
had 2048-byte blocks rather than the 2334-byte mode2 format2
blocksize. If you were to mount the CD filesystem you might see the
second smaller number in a listing there.

The exact meaning of the attributes section is listed below:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The 1st character is either "d" if the entry is a directory, or "-" if
not.
@item
The 2nd character is either "a" if the entry is CDDA (audio), or "-"
if not.
@item
The 3rd character is either "i" if the entry is interleaved, or "-" if
not.
@item
The 4th character is either "2" if the entry is mode2 form2 or "-" if
not.
@item
The 5th character is either "1" if the entry is mode2 form1 or "-" if
not.Note that an entry will either be in mode2 form1 or mode form2. That
is you will either see "2-" or "-1" in the 4th & 5th positions.
@item
The 6th and 7th characters refer to permissions for everyone while the
@item
the 8th and 9th characters refer to permissions for a group while, and
@item
the 10th and 11th characters refer to permissions for a user.
@end itemize
 
In each of these pairs the first character (6, 8, 10) is "x" if the
entry is executable. For a directory this means the directory is
allowed to be listed or "searched".  The second character of a pair
(7, 9, 11) is "r" if the entry is allowed to be read.

The item in brackets, e.g. @kbd{[lsn 450]} for the AVSEQ01.DAT entry
is the ``logical sector number'' or the place on the CD where the
entry starts.

@node Entries
@section Entries Section

Here is part of sample output from the VCD used above.

@smallexample
VCD/ENTRIES.VCD
 ID: `ENTRYVCD'
 version: 0x02
 system profile tag: 0x00
 entries: 31
 ENTRY[00]: track# 1 (SEQUENCE[0]), LSN 450 (msf 00:08:00)
 ENTRY[01]: track# 1 (SEQUENCE[0]), LSN 482 (msf 00:08:32)
 ENTRY[02]: track# 1 (SEQUENCE[0]), LSN 5888 (msf 01:20:38)
 ENTRY[03]: track# 1 (SEQUENCE[0]), LSN 8925 (msf 02:01:00)
 ...
@end smallexample

In the above example, in the first line corresponds the ``filename''
in the files section that starts at logical sector number 151. If this
VCD were in SVCD format that line would probably say
``SVCD/ENTRIES.SVD.'' As is indicated above I made 31 entries for the
VCD; only the first 4 are shown. Depending on how playback control is
set up you should be able to randomly access up to 31 different
playback locations on this VCD. If you use a media player like xine
and my plugin for it, there is a way jump to the beginning of each of
these entries.

The ``track #'' and SEQUENCE number are about the same thing, the
track being one more than the SEQUENCE number. Note the first entry is
also at logical sector number 450, the same as AVSEQ01.DAT. In other
words ``Entry 0'' is the start of the movie.

The minutes, seconds, frames number (msf 00:08:00) is equivalent to
the LSN number. For those who wonder how to from the MSF to the LSN
you basically multiply the seconds (8) by 75 since there are 75 frames
in a second (note this has nothing to do with how fast this is
displayed). If you get this you get 600 which is a bit large. But
that's because the MSF number 00:00:00 is equal to 150 or the ``pregap
sector size.''

There is one track on this SVCD with two audio streams (channel 0 is
in German and stream 1 is in English but the language information
can't be determined from information on the dist). The video stream is
in PAL format and there is a subtitle as OGT (Overlay Graphics
Text). The subtitle's a private stream id in the MPEG file ahs
hexidecimal number 0xde.

The bottom part of the display shows track info obtained in a
lower-level way. Most of the information above comes from metadata
read in that IS09660 filesystem. If you are reading from a device this
information comes from comes requsts from the device to give track
information. If what you are reading is a disk image, the only way to
get this information has to come from the CUE file which is why it is
better to specify a CUE file than a BIN file.

Perhaps you want to dump all information about the CD that is

that is ``default'' for that OS then this might work:

  vcddump --cdrom-device
@end smallexample 

I have a combined CD-ROM and DVD drive; my CD-ROM drive also can write
and seems to draw more power; so I prefer to read from the DVD
drive. Since that is not the ``default'' (@kbd{/dev/cdrom}) on my
Linux box, I have to give a location. So this will work: 

@smallexample
  vcddump --cdrom-device=/dev/dvd
@end smallexample 

Or even better, I'll let @value{program} figure out it's a CD-ROM device:
@smallexample
  vcddump -i /dev/dvd
@end smallexample 
The equals sign before @kbd{/dev/dvd} is optional in either format.

Let's say you just used vcdimager or vcdxbuild it created output to
its ``default'' location (probably @kbd{videocd.cue} and
@kbd{videocd.bin}. To dump out this out:
@smallexample
  vcddump -c
@end smallexample 

But if you specified the output to go to say @kbd{nausicaa.bin} and
@kbd{nausicaa.cue} you would have to specify that location like this:
@smallexample
  vcddump -c nausicaa.cue
@end smallexample 

Or again not having to worry about what type of file you could use 
the ``intelligent'' input option again as we did before:
@smallexample
  vcddump -i nausicaa.cue
@end smallexample 

Okay, now for for some more obscure stuff. Let's say I'm writing a
front-end GUI to do all sorts of stuff and I just need something to
pick out the format (VCD 1.1, VCD 2.0, SVCD, HQVCD) that a VCD in
drive is located. Since I have to read in this output, I don't want
any extra lines not relevant other than the version. 

@smallexample
  vcddump --no-banner --show-format
@end smallexample 

Or even shorter:
@smallexample
  vcddump -t -f
@end smallexample 

I want to see the filesystem info and track info for the CD
in my default drive

@smallexample
  vcddump --show-tracks --show-filesystem
@end smallexample 

I want to see the filesystem info and track info for the CD
in my default drive

And finally I want to see just the ``data'' part --- that is the list
of the entries section, no summary information like a count or ID tag.
@smallexample
  vcddump --show-entries data
@end smallexample
