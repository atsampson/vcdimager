@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

Note in the guide, we use the term VCD to mean some sort of Video
Compact Disk. There are various formats of Video Compact Disks, the
oldest format of which is called VCD followed by a version number:
1.0, 1.1 or 2.0. Hopefully by context it should be clear whether we
are referring to a class of Video Compact Disks or the specific older
format called VCD @emph{version-number}.

@value{program} can be used to extract or disassemble the contents of
a CD or a CD disk image (commonly referred to as ``ripping'').
@cindex ripping
So in a sense @value{program} is the inverse of @kbd{vcdxbuild}---if
you use @value{program} followed by @kbd{vcdxbuild} on the result and
then use another @value{program}, you should get exactly what you got
the first time you used @value{program} (assuming everything is
working correctly).

But @value{program} can also disassemble pieces of a CD or CD disk
image and can create an XML Video CD description file without
extracting a single file located on the CD.

You might use @value{program} as a step in remastering or reauthoring
and existing CD, or it could be used to extract MPEGs from a CD or CD
disk image file. 

Since VCD's use the ISO-9660 format, another way to ``extract'' an
MPEG or piece of a VCD is simply to mount the CD and use file copy
commands. However this program will interpret the Video-CD specific
files and output a corresponding XML description file.  So
@value{program} is something similar to the program @kbd{vcddump};
however the latter gives lower-level Video-CD specific information and
does not output its results in XML.

@node Command Options
@chapter Command Options

There are a number of miscellaneous options, but there some broad
categories of options. There is a set of options for specifying what
not to dump, these all start @kbd{--no} and another set of options
which specify where the CD-ROM or CD-ROM disk-image is.

@end menu

@node Where Options
@section Options controlling where to read from 

If you don't specify any place to read from @value{program} will try
to read from the default device that may be appropriate for your OS.

There are two broad categories of input, reading from a device that
contains a Compact Disk, and reading from a file on the filesystem
that contains an image that could be burned into a Compact Disk.  The
option for the former category, reading a physical CD, is
@kbd{--cdrom-device} (@kbd{-C}); options for the latter category,
reading a file containing a CD disk image, are @kbd{--bin-file}
(@kbd{-b}), @kbd{--nrg-file} (@kbd{-N}). There is one other option
@kbd{--input} (@kbd{-i}) which blurs the distinction---it tries to
figure out based on the name whether you are reading from a device
containing a CD or not and do the appropriate thing.  Of course, since
it only makes sense to read from one place, these options are mutually
exclusive; use only one option from this set.

@menu
* BIN/CUE or NRG file::   Reading from a file containing a CD disk image
* CD-ROM Device::         Reading from a CD-ROM device
* Intelligent Input::     Reading from whereever
@end menu

@node BIN/CUE or NRG file
@subsection Reading from a file containing a CD disk image
@cindex Reading, BIN, or NRG CD-ROM disk image

The option @kbd{--bin-file} (the short forms for thise are @kbd{-b})
indicate to read from a file containing an image what might be burned
onto Compact Disk. The format is expected to be in the BIN/CUE format
that cdrdao uses and is used by a popular DOS/Windows CD mastering
tool.

If you use the @kbd{--bin-file} option, the file read is expected to
be the ``.BIN'' part---this is the bulk of the data.

If you use the @kbd{--nrg-file} option (short form @kbd{-N}), the file
read is expected to be a CD-ROM disk image using a proprietary and
unpublished format used by the Nero burning software. Because this is
proprietary and not published, this code has been reverse engineered
and we really can't do as good a job as we can with a cue-sheet file.
It's better not to work with such things when possible.

If you do not specify a file name after @kbd{--bin-file}, a default
name is used ``videocd.bin'' is probably used

@node CD-ROM Device
@subsection Reading from CD-ROM Device
@cindex Reading, CD-ROM Device

The option @kbd{--cdrom-device} or the short form @kbd{-C} is used
when you want to read from a Compact Disk. The name given would be the
device name. If you don't specify a device, a default will be selected
based on the Operating System or information that can be gleaned from
the OS. For example on GNU/Linux, the default device may be
@kbd{/dev/cdrom}, while on Solaris it might be
@kbd{/vol/dev/aliases/cdrom0}.

@node Intelligent Input
@subsection Reading from whereever
@cindex Reading, whereever

The option @kbd{--input} or the short form of this @kbd{-i} tries to
be intelligent by trying to figure out whether the thing you are
referring to is a device or a bin/cue disk image of a CD.

Currently the algorithm it uses is pretty simple. If the thing
referred to is what in Unix is called a ``block'' or ``character''
device, then it assumes a device name. When you do ``long listing''
(``ls -l'') of the name and track down possible symbolic links
you will see a ``b'' or ``c'' in the first colum if the file is a
block or character devcies.

If the thing referred to in an @kbd{--input} option is a ``regular''
file then it is assumed you have a file image of a CD. If the filename
ends (i.e. the extension is) ``.bin'' or ``.BIN'' then we assume a
``BIN file'' and if the filename ends ``.nrg or ``.NRG then we assume
a Nero NRG disk image.

Although this algorithm is subject to change and there may be more
sophisticated or alternative methods, in practice I think this does
pretty much what's expected.

@node What Options
@section Options controlling what do you want done

By default @value{program} will extract everything it can about a VCD
image. 

However if you specify something in particular you don't want to
extract, for example you don't want to extract the tracks or
``segments'' use  @kbd{--nosegments}.

@node All Options
@section A complete list of options

First some general-purpose options. These you might find on other
programs.

@table @code
@item --help
@kindex @code{--help}
This option give a list of options type @kbd{--help}. @kbd{-?} is an
abbreviation however you will probably have to ``escape'' the question
mark so that the shell doesn't interpret this; i.e. you may have to
type @kbd{-\?}.

@item --usage
@kindex @code{--usage}
This option shows an abbreviated usage message

@item --verbose
@itemx -v
@kindex @code{--verbose}
This opton gives more verbose, debugging output.

@item --quiet
@itemx -q
@kindex @code{--quiet}
Show only critical messages

@item --version
@itemx -V
@kindex @code{--version}
Display version and copyright information and exit after displaying
this information. Sometimes, you just wanna know what version you got.
@end table

Use at most one option in an invocation from the following list. These
options are described in general in @ref{Where Options, ,Options
controlling where to read from}.

@table @code
@item --bin-file @ovar{filename}
@itemx -b @ovar{filename}
@kindex @code{--bin-file}
Specifies a BIN CD-ROM disk image to read from. See @ref{BIN/CUE or NRG
file, ,Reading from a file containing a CD disk image}.


@item --cdrom-device @ovar{device-name}
@itemx -C @ovar{device-name}
@kindex @code{--cdrom-device}
Specifies a CD-ROM device to read from. See @ref{CD-ROM
Device, ,Reading from CD-ROM Device}.

@item --nrg-file @ovar{filename}
@itemx -N @ovar{filename}
@kindex @code{--nrg-file}
Specifies a Nero NRG-format CD-ROM disk image to read from. See
@ref{BIN/CUE or NRG file, ,Reading from a file containing a CD disk
image}.

@item --input @ovar{file or device name}
@itemx -i @ovar{file or device name}
@kindex @code{--input}
This option is insensitive to whether the thing reading from is a
CD-ROM device or a file. See @ref{Intelligent Input, ,Reading from
whereever}.

@end table

@table @code
@item --sector-2336
@kindex @code{--sector-2336}
This option only makes sense if you are reading from a BIN CD disk
image This indicates to @value{program} to assume a 2336-byte sector
mode for image file. @emph{Note: This option is slated to disappear.}

@item --progress
@itemx -p
@kindex @code{--progress}
Show progress.

@item --no-ext-psd
@kindex @code{--no-ext-psd}
Ignore extended PSD (located in the ISO-9660 filesystem under
@kbd{/EXT/PSD_X.VCD}) and use the ``standard'' PSD.

@item --output-file
@itemx -o
@kindex @code{--output-file}
Specify the place to write the output XML description file. The
default is @kbd{videocd.xml}.

@end table

The options below reduce what is extracted. 

@table @code
@item --nofiles
@kindex @code{--nofiles}
Video CD's are formatted on an ISO 9660 filesystem. As such they may
have additional files that are not strictly necessary for VCD
operation. For example, there may be some additional documentation or
commentary in some sort of text format and these may be put under
additional directories.  Nnormally, such files are extracted with the
directory or path information removed. If you don't want these
additional files extracted use the @code{--nofiles} option. 

Using @code{--nofiles} will still extract files which are necessary
for VCD playback however. (These are located under the /SEGMENT, /EXT,
/CDDDA, /SVCD, and/or /VCD directories).  The options below however
may affect VCD operation and they are mutually exclusive of this
operation. That is, this operation does not touch any of the files
that the options below will and vice versa.

@item --nosegments
@kindex @code{--nosegments}
@cindex segments
Segment play items are usually stored one per ``track'' in the CD, are
an MPEG of some sort.  They often constitute the bulk of the CD, and
when extracted by this program will start have a name of the form
@code{avseq@emph{dd}.mpg} where @emph{dd} is a two-digit number.

Segment items are located in under the /SEGMENT directory on the
CD. However when extracted these directories do not appear.

If you don't want to extract these MPEG files, use this option. You
may however might not be able create a CD image back unless some of
these files are created or the XML description modified.  Another way
to ``extract'' these file might be to ``mount'' the CD and use your
OS's file copy commands.

@item --nosequences
@kindex @code{--nosequences}
@cindex sequences
Sequence items are usually smaller than segment item and can be stored
with more than on item per track. They often constitute for menus or
still frame selections. When extracted by this program will start have
a name of the form @code{item@emph{dddd}.mpg} where @emph{dddd} is a
four-digit number.

Sequence items are located in under the /MPEGAV, /MPEG2 directories.
However when extracted these directories do not appear.

If you don't want to extract these MPEG files, use this option. You
may however might not be able create a CD image back unless some of
these files are created or the XML description modified.  Another way
to ``extract'' these file might be to ``mount'' the CD and use your
OS's file copy commands.

@item --norip
@kindex @code{--norip}
Just create an XML description file of the format used by
@kbd{vcdxbuild}. Using this option is like adding the options
@kbd{--nofiles}, @kbd{--nosequences}, @kbd{--nosegments}.

When you use this option you will get the warning message:

@smallexample
Entry point and auto pause locations cannot be
determined without mpeg extraction -- hope that's ok.
@end smallexample

Without looking into the MPEG's we don't know how big they are and
therefore can't verify if entry points and auto pause lie inside the
MPEGs.

@end table

@node Some Examples
@chapter Some simple command invocations.

Perhaps all you want to do is rip a CD onto your disk to modify it.
If the CD is in the default location for your OS, then this might
work:

@noindent
@smallexample
vcdxrip
@end smallexample 

It means the same thing as:

@noindent
@smallexample
vcdxrip --cdrom-device
@end smallexample 

and using the short option:

@noindent
@smallexample
vcdxrip -C
@end smallexample 

I have a combined CD-ROM and DVD drive called @kbd{/dev/dvd}. I have
another CD-ROM drive which goes under the name @kbd{/dev/cdrom}, but I
generally prefer to use the DVD/CD-ROM drive for reading since it
doesn't seem to run as hot. Since that drive is not the ``default''
(@kbd{/dev/cdrom}) on my GNU/Linux box, I have to give a location. So
this will work:

@noindent
@smallexample
vcddump -C=/dev/dvd
@end smallexample 

Or even better, I'll let @value{program} figure out it's a CD-ROM device:

@noindent
@smallexample
vcddump -i /dev/dvd
@end smallexample 

The equals sign before @kbd{/dev/dvd} is optional in either format.

Let's say you just used @kbd{vcdimager} or @kbd{vcdxbuild} it created output to
its ``default'' location (probably @kbd{videocd.cue} and
@kbd{videocd.bin}. To dump out this out:

@noindent
@smallexample
vcdxrip --bin-file
@end smallexample 

But if you specified the output to go to say @kbd{nausicaa.bin} and
@kbd{nausicaa.cue} you would have to specify that location like this:

@noindent
@smallexample
vcdxrip -b nausicaa.bin
@end smallexample 

Or again not having to worry about what type of file you could use 
the ``intelligent'' input option again as we did before:

@noindent
@smallexample
vcddump -i nausicaa.bin
@end smallexample 

If I want the XML file that gets created to to ``nausicaa.xml'' rather
than ``videocd.xml'' then use this: 

@noindent
@smallexample
vcddump -i nausicaa.bin -o nausicaa.xml
@end smallexample 

And if I just want the XML description only for this:

@noindent
@smallexample
vcddump --norip -i nausicaa.bin --output-file nausicaa.xml
@end smallexample 

Suppose I want extract only the big MPEGs of the CD in the default CD
without menus and extra file information. This is probably close:

@noindent
@smallexample
vcddump --noseqeunces --nofiles
@end smallexample 

The above will create an XML description file. Suppose on the other
hand I just want the extraneous files but not the MPEG data of the CD
in the default CD-ROM drive, then this may work:

@noindent
@smallexample
vcddump --noseqeunces --nosegments
@end smallexample
