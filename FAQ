VCDIMAGER FAQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: ...cdrdao does not understand .cue-style toc-sheets!?

A: make sure you use at least version 1.1.4 of cdrdao. 
   (see also cdrdao's man page!)

Q: I converted the .bin/.cue files to an .iso image and burned it. Why
   can't I access the movie tracks?

A: You must burn the Video CD image in DAO mode, converting it to an
   'ISO Image' destroys important data stored in the cdrom mode 2 type sectors.

Q: When I double click on the application, a window flashes up and gets closed
   fast again. What am I doing wrong?

A: 'vcdimager' is the commandline frontend, and as such it is not a GUI.

- -

Q: The MPEG streams on (S)VCDs have a RIFF CD-XA header, how do I create such
   one?

A: There is no need to create one; Some operating systems wrap such a header
   around XA form2 files, i.e. the RIFF header is not contained on the (S)VCD.
   Vcdimager does not support RIFF wrapped MPEG streams, only plain MPEG 
   program streams are.
