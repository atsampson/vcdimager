@unnumbered Introduction

@c fixme add node structure

@dfn{GNU VCDImager}@footnote{see
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/vcdimager/}} is a
tool for pre-mastering @acronym{CDROM} images suitable for being burned
to CD recordables. It takes @acronym{MPEG} movie files as input and
generates an image file and a cuesheet file which can be fed to any
CD-recording program which understands the @acronym{BIN/CUE}-format,
e.g. cdrdao@footnote{see @url{http://www.ping.de/sites/daneb/cdrdao.html}}.

@noindent
Features (so far) include:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Video CD 1.1 image output support

@item
Video CD 2.0 image output support

@item
Super Video CD 1.0 image output support

@item
general facility for adding files as mode 2 form 1 and 2 sectors to
the @acronym{ISO9660} filesystem and setting the @acronym{ISO9660}
volume label and application id fields.

@item
support for up to 98 @acronym{MPEG} tracks per (Super) Video CD.

@end itemize

This packages comes with @dfn{GNU VCDRip}, a tool for showing
information about (Super) Video CD images and extracting the contained
@acronym{MPEG}-streams.

@c fixme write much more :-)

@chapter Video CD Concepts

This chapter gives some background information regarding the underlying
Video CD technology.

@section General Information

The Video Compact Disc (@dfn{Video CD} or @dfn{VCD}) is a standardized
digital video storage format. It is based on the commonly available
Compact Disc technology, which allows for low cost video authoring.
Video CDs can be played in most DVD standalone player, dedicated VCD
players and finally most modern computer based systems with multimedia
support.

@section Anatomy of Video CDs

In general the layout of a Video CD is made up of the following areas:

@itemize @bullet
@item
ISO9660 data track

@itemize @bullet
@item
ISO9660 structure at 00:02:00, consisting of 16 empty sectors, primary
volume descriptor (@dfn{PVD}) and directory records with file pointers
to the later mentioned information area structures and external pointers
to MPEG/CD-DA tracks following the ISO9660 data track.

@item
optional karaoke area at 00:03:00

@item
Video CD information area at 00:04:00

@item
optional segment play item area with mpeg items aligned in 150 sector
segments

@item
optional program and data file area, for additonal files added to the
ISO9660 track

@end itemize

@item
up to 98 MPEG mode 2 form 2 or CD-DA tracks embedded in lead-in and
lead-out empty sectors.

@end itemize

@section Known Video CD Flavours

There are different Video CD flavours commonly used. The following
sections tries to explain the differences amongst them.

@subsection Video CD 1.1

This is the most basic Video CD specification dating back to
1993@footnote{actually this flavour was based on the KaraokeCD.}, which
has the following characteristics:

@itemize @bullet
@item
one mode 2 mixed form ISO9660 track containing file pointers to the
information areas

@item
up to 98 MPEG-1 A/V streams or CD-DA audio tracks

@item
up to 500 track entry points

@end itemize

@noindent
The Video CD 1.1 specification supported only two movie resolutions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
352 x 240 @@ 29.97 Hz (@acronym{NTSC})
@item
352 x 240 @@ 23.976 Hz (@acronym{FILM})
@end itemize

@subsection Video CD 2.0

About two years after the Video CD 1.1 specification came out, an
improved Video CD 2.0 standard was published. This one added the
following items to the features already available in the 1.1
specification:

@itemize @bullet
@item
optional support for MPEG segment play items (@dfn{SPI}), consisting of
still pictures, motion pictures or audio streams, was added.

@item
optional support for interactive playback control (@dfn{PBC}) was added

@item
optional support for playing related access by providing a scanpoint
index file was added (@file{EXT/SCANDATA.DAT})

@end itemize

@noindent
By adding PAL support to the Video CD 1.1 specification, the following
resolution become available:
@itemize @bullet
@item
352 x 240 @@ 29.97 Hz (@acronym{NTSC})
@item
352 x 240 @@ 23.976 Hz (@acronym{FILM})
@item
352 x 288 @@ 25 Hz (@acronym{PAL})
@end itemize

@subsection Extended Video CD

Also known as @dfn{XVCD}, this is not an official standard. It's
actually just a name for VCDs trying to break conformance to the
official standards in order to use the additonal performance of the DVD
decoders and thus achieve better image quality. Such a XVCD may be
unsupported by many available standalone playing devices.

@subsection Super Video CD 1.0

With the upcomming of the DVD media, a new VCD standard had to be
published in order to be able to keep up with technology, so the Super
Video CD specification was called into life. Most notably a switch from
MPEG-1 CBR to MPEG-2 VBR encoding for the video stream was performed. Based on the Video CD 2.0 features the following items are new:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Use of MPEG-2 encoding instead of MPEG-1 for the video stream

@item
Allowed VBR encoding of MPEG-1 audio stream

@item
Higher resolutions for motion pictures.

@item
Overlay graphics (@dfn{OGT}) and text sub-channel coding for user
switchable subtitle displaying
@end itemize

@noindent
For the Super Video CD only the following two resolutions are supported:

@itemize @bullet
@item
480 x 480 @@ 29.97 Hz (@acronym{NTSC})
@item
480 x 576 @@ 25 Hz (@acronym{PAL})
@end itemize

@subsection Extended Super Video CD

Just like the XVCD, and thus also known as @dfn{XSVCD}, this is not an
official standard and may not work with all playing devices supporting
SVCDs.

@subsection Requirements For input MPEG streams

GNU VCDImager expects @acronym{MPEG} streams in a format suitable for
(Super) Video CD production.

@subsubsection Video CD

The Video CD specification requires the @acronym{MPEG}-1 stream to
have a maximum constant bitrate of 1151929.1 bits/sec and to have one of
the following resolution:

@itemize @bullet
@item
352 x 240 @@ 29.97 Hz (@acronym{NTSC})
@item
352 x 240 @@ 23.976 Hz (@acronym{FILM})
@item
352 x 288 @@ 25 Hz (@acronym{PAL}) (not supported on VCD 1.x!)
@end itemize

The audio stream must be @acronym{MPEG}-1 layer II, fixed to a 224
kbits/sec constant bitrate with 1 stereo or 2 mono channels.

@subsubsection Super Video CD

When creating Super Video CD images @acronym{MPEG}-2 @acronym{VBR}
streams are expected with a maximum allowed bitrate of ~2.6 mbits/sec.
The following video resolutions are supported:

@itemize @bullet
@item
480 x 480 @@ 29.97 Hz (@acronym{NTSC})
@item
480 x 576 @@ 25 Hz (@acronym{PAL})
@end itemize

The audio stream must be @acronym{MPEG}-1 layer II, with a bitrate
ranging from 32 to 384 kbps kbits/sec bitrate with up to 2 stereo or 4
mono channels.

@subsubsection Common Constraints

Furthermore the @acronym{MPEG} files need to be aligned to 2324 byte
@acronym{MPEG} packet boundaries. So if GNU VCDImager complains, try
fixing those files with VCDpad
@footnote{see @url{http://www.nocrew.org/?part=vcdpad}} 
or any other program capable of aligning or fixing @acronym{MPEG}
packets.

@subsection Adding Files to the Video CD 

Files can be added to the @acronym{ISO} filesystem, that is the first
track of the Video CD, by making use of the commandline options
@option{--add-file=@var{FILE},@var{ISO_FILENAME}} and
@option{--add-file-2336=@var{FILE},@var{ISO_FILENAME}}.
The latter option allows you to include files containing the complete
user data of mode 2 cdrom sectors
@footnote{8 bytes for subheader, 2324 bytes payload and finaly 4 bytes
for @acronym{EDC}}.

The pathname given as @var{ISO_FILENAME} determines where to link the
file in the filesystem of the Video CD. The given pathname must be a
valid ISO9660 filename with the following restrictions:
@itemize @bullet
@item
The Character set is restricted to upper case letters, numbers, the
underscore @samp{_}, the dot @samp{.} and the slash @samp{/}.

@item
The maximum filename length is restricted to 31 characters, the
directory nesting level is restricted to 8 and the maximum path length
is limited to 255 characters.

@item
Filenames must contain exactly one dot.@footnote{If no filename
extension is supposed to exist the dot must be placed as a trailing
dot.}

@item
The pathname must not begin or end with a slash. Nor should it contain
slashes following directly each other.

@end itemize

If the parent directory for a file entry does not exist it will be
created automatically on demand.

@subsection CD-i Support
There is no specific CD-i support in GNU VCDImager. But you
can use the general facilites for adding a custom CD-i player
application. 

Say you had a CD-i application consisting of the files
@file{cdi_imag.rtf}, @file{cdi_text.fnt}, @file{cdi_vcd.app} and
@file{cdi_vcd.cfg}, with @file{cdi_vcd.app} being the main application
executable, you could add the following lines to your @file{~/.popt}
popt@footnote{see documentation for popt for more information about
option aliasing} aliasing file@footnote{add it to @file{/etc/popt} if
the setting should be available system-wide}

@example
vcdimager alias --cdi \
	--iso-application-id "CDI/CDI_VCD.APP;1" \
	--add-file-2336 /usr/share/cdi/cdi_imag.rtf,CDI/CDI_IMAG.RTF \
	--add-file      /usr/share/cdi/cdi_text.fnt,CDI/CDI_TEXT.FNT \
	--add-file      /usr/share/cdi/cdi_vcd.app,CDI/CDI_VCD.APP \
	--add-file      /usr/share/cdi/cdi_vcd.cfg,CDI/CDI_VCD.CFG 
@end example



@section @file{vcdrip} Tool

The @file{vcdrip} utility offers just a few commandline options:
@example
@cartouche
$ vcdrip --help
Usage: vcdrip [OPTION...]
  --bin-file=FILE         set image file as source
  --cdrom-device=DEVICE   set CDROM device as source (linux only)
  --dump                  dump information about Video CD
  --rip                   rip mpeg tracks
  -V, --version           display version and copyright information 
                          and exit

@chapter Examples

@section Simple Multitrack Example

In the following example session, the files @file{track1.mpg},
@file{track2.mpg} and @file{track3.mpg} are mastered into the default
output files @file{videocd.cue} and @file{videocd.bin}. The volume label
is set to `My Test VCD'.

@example
@cartouche
$ vcdimager --iso-volume-label="My Test VCD" track1.mpg track2 track3.mpg 
finished ok, image created with 13421 sectors (31566192 bytes)
$
@end cartouche
@end example

@section MPEG track Extraction

The next example show how to extract the mpeg streams contained
in the image file @file{test.bin} (the resulting streams are stored in
files named @file{track_##.mpg} with @samp{##} being the track number,
starting with 0).

@example
@cartouche
$ vcdrip-devel --rip --bin-file=test.bin     
--DEBUG: found ENTRIES.VCD/SVD
   INFO: track_00.mpg: 1262 -> 2555
--DEBUG:  stream leadin at 1292
--DEBUG:  stream leadout at 2360
   INFO: track_01.mpg: 2555 -> 101705
--DEBUG:  stream leadin at 2585
--DEBUG:  stream leadout at 101510
   INFO: track_02.mpg: 101705 -> 200994
--DEBUG:  stream leadin at 101735
--DEBUG:  stream leadout at 200799
